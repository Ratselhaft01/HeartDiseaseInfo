            <h2>What is Heart Disease?</h2>
            <p>Information about heart disease and its impact on health.</p>
            <h3>Diet:</h3>
            <p>
                A healthy diet is essential in improving your heart health and preventing cardiovascular disease. There are many things that an individual can do right now to improve their diet. 
            </p>
            <h4>Reduce your salt intake</h4>
            <p>
                Salt is something that is included in many foods to bring out flavors in them. However, too much salt in your diet can lead to high blood pressure (hypertension) which is a risk factor for heart disease. Salt is added to our foods but it is also high in canned foods, frozen foods, and fast foods. To help reduce your salt intake you can make foods at home because you can then control how much salt goes into your food. You can also substitute for low sodium (salt) or sodium free foods and condiments. An adult should have less than 2,300 mg of salt but ideally closer to 1,500 mg of salt.
            </p>
            <h4>Reduce your fat intake</h4>
            <p>
                Fats are also found in a lot of common foods and are something that you can reduce in order to improve your diet. By reducing the amount of fat that you have in your diet you can lower your cholesterol levels (amount of fat in your blood) and therefore lower your risk for heart diseases such as coronary artery disease. To help reduce this you can trim fat off meats and eat lean meats. Choose things that have healthy fats such as avocados, salmon, and nuts while also avoiding things that have trans fat. You should also change what oils you use while cooking (you can use olive or canola oil and avoid using butter). It is recommended that adults have less than 6% of their daily calories in saturated fats and avoid trans fats.  
            </p>
            <h4>Include more fruits and vegetables</h4>
            <p>
                Fresh fruits and vegetables are essential to have in a healthy diet. They are filled with fibers and nutrients that help aid in improving your health and improve how you feel. There are many easy ways that you can include them in your diet. You can cook your own food and choose recipes that include fruits and vegetables, you can cut up fresh fruits and vegetables and keep them in your fridge to snack on, or you can keep frozen fruits and vegetables to take out when you need them. You can steam vegetables to create a side dish, or just cut fruits to eat with dinner. Make sure to avoid canned fruits and vegetables as they add a lot more salt to your meal and they are not as good for you as fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables.
            </p>
            <h4>Include more whole grains and fiber</h4>
            <p>
                Whole grains and fiber are great things to have more of in a diet. By including whole grains you can get more nutrients out of your foods and reduce the risk for high blood pressure, which is a risk factor for heart disease. You can include more whole wheat and fiber in your diet by eating whole wheat breads and pastas, eating things that are fortified or high in fiber, and reduced and refined grains. Fiber is found in foods that are plant based such as produce and grains so by including more plant based foods you can improve your fiber intake. 
            </p>
            <h4>Plan your meals</h4>
            <p>
                By planning your meals ahead of time you can actively choose to include healthy things into what you make. When you plan ahead you can shop for the things that you will need that week, you can choose to add things into what you make ahead of time, and it helps reduce stress about deciding what to eat. By planning ahead you can make healthy dietary choices by including more fruits and vegetables,  lean proteins, and reduce the amount of fat and salt in your food.
