            <h2>What is Heart Disease?</h2>            
            <p>Cardiovascular disease (also known as heart disease) is an umbrella term for the many different types of heart problems that individuals can have. The requisite to be used under this term is that it must be something that affects the heart or the blood vessels. This includes diseases such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, arrhythmias, valve disorders or diseases, and deep vein thrombosis. Heart disease is very prevalent and is currently the number one killer in the United States and the world. It is also estimated that almost half of the United States population has some form of cardiovascular disease. With this being so prevalent, it is important that individuals take steps to prevent heart disease and reduce their risk to it.</p>

        <section id="what-causes-it">
            <h2>What Causes It?</h2>
            <p>There are many things that can put an individual at risk for heart disease. One thing that makes a person more prone to heart disease is having risk factors for it. Risk factors that increase the chance of cardiovascular disease include having hypertension (high blood pressure), tobacco use, high cholesterol (the amount of fat in blood), family history of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, high alcohol intake, and a sedentary lifestyle. These things can cause heart problems by causing plaques to form on blood vessels (called arteriosclerosis which leads to coronary artery disease), causing the heart to work harder than it should for long periods of time, and by causing damage to vessels. There are things that individuals can do to help prevent themself from getting these risk factors and getting heart disease. </p>

            <h2>How Can It Be Prevented?</h2>
            <p>There are many things that can be done to prevent cardiovascular disease. These things include improving your diet, exercising, and making other healthy choices. This section goes in depth on things that you can choose to do to prevent yourself from getting heart disease. </p>
            <h3>Diet:</h3>
            <p>
                A healthy diet is essential in improving your heart health and preventing cardiovascular disease. There are many things that an individual can do right now to improve their diet. 
            </p>
            <h4>Reduce your salt intake</h4>
            <p>
                Salt is something that is included in many foods to bring out flavors in them. However, too much salt in your diet can lead to high blood pressure (hypertension) which is a risk factor for heart disease. Salt is added to our foods but it is also high in canned foods, frozen foods, and fast foods. To help reduce your salt intake you can make foods at home because you can then control how much salt goes into your food. You can also substitute for low sodium (salt) or sodium free foods and condiments. An adult should have less than 2,300 mg of salt but ideally closer to 1,500 mg of salt.
            </p>
            <h4>Reduce your fat intake</h4>
            <p>
                Fats are also found in a lot of common foods and are something that you can reduce in order to improve your diet. By reducing the amount of fat that you have in your diet you can lower your cholesterol levels (amount of fat in your blood) and therefore lower your risk for heart diseases such as coronary artery disease. To help reduce this you can trim fat off meats and eat lean meats. Choose things that have healthy fats such as avocados, salmon, and nuts while also avoiding things that have trans fat. You should also change what oils you use while cooking (you can use olive or canola oil and avoid using butter). It is recommended that adults have less than 6% of their daily calories in saturated fats and avoid trans fats.  
            </p>
            <h4>Include more fruits and vegetables</h4>
            <p>
                Fresh fruits and vegetables are essential to have in a healthy diet. They are filled with fibers and nutrients that help aid in improving your health and improve how you feel. There are many easy ways that you can include them in your diet. You can cook your own food and choose recipes that include fruits and vegetables, you can cut up fresh fruits and vegetables and keep them in your fridge to snack on, or you can keep frozen fruits and vegetables to take out when you need them. You can steam vegetables to create a side dish, or just cut fruits to eat with dinner. Make sure to avoid canned fruits and vegetables as they add a lot more salt to your meal and they are not as good for you as fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables.
            </p>
            <h4>Include more whole grains and fiber</h4>
            <p>
                Whole grains and fiber are great things to have more of in a diet. By including whole grains you can get more nutrients out of your foods and reduce the risk for high blood pressure, which is a risk factor for heart disease. You can include more whole wheat and fiber in your diet by eating whole wheat breads and pastas, eating things that are fortified or high in fiber, and reduced and refined grains. Fiber is found in foods that are plant based such as produce and grains so by including more plant based foods you can improve your fiber intake. 
            </p>
            <h4>Plan your meals</h4>
            <p>
                By planning your meals ahead of time you can actively choose to include healthy things into what you make. When you plan ahead you can shop for the things that you will need that week, you can choose to add things into what you make ahead of time, and it helps reduce stress about deciding what to eat. By planning ahead you can make healthy dietary choices by including more fruits and vegetables,  lean proteins, and reduce the amount of fat and salt in your food.

            </p>
            <h3>Exercise:</h3>
            <p>
                Physical exercise is a huge part of reducing the risk for cardiovascular disease. By exercising, risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity decrease; which leads to a decreased risk for heart disease. By exercising you can lower your blood pressure, lower your cholesterol, and cause the release of chemicals that prevent plaques from forming on arteries. It is recommended that an adult spends 2 and a half hours a week getting moderate to high aerobic exercise (meaning exercise that is rhythmic and increases your heart rate). These are exercises such as running, biking, and swimming. It is also recommended to do a bit of strength training each week such as weight training or resistance exercise. It can also improve your heart health if you spend less time sitting. You can do simple things such as standing, calf raises, squats, or wall sits to reduce time spent sitting. The best thing that you can do is to start now. Just start doing a little bit more than what you are currently doing and build upon it. An activity is better than being sedentary. Here are some ideas for things that you can do for moderate and high aerobic exercises.
            </p>

            <h3>Heart Healthy Choices:</h3>
            <p>
                There are other things besides diet and exercise that individuals can do to reduce the risk of developing heart disease. You can avoid the use of tobacco products and quit using tobacco products if you currently use them. These products include cigarets, vaping, and chewing tobacco. When an individual uses tobacco products it can increase their risk for heart disease in many ways. It raises triglyceride levels (a type of fat in blood), can cause blood clots, thickens and narrows blood vessels, damages blood vessels, and causes plaques to form. These things can lead to many different heart problems and lead to heart disease. Prevent yourself from being exposed to tobacco (either first or second hand) to help improve your heart health.
